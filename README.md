# WaterAid: A Prototype News Application

Inspired by BBC News, this is a prototype iOS news application which takes data
from WaterAid's "Country Programmes" (water development programmes run in
countries around the world) and provides an easier way for donators, or
potential donators to engage with operations being run abroad.

## Random Hacks of Kindness, December 2012
